# Inventory Tracking - Jewlery 
For my project I will be creating a simple inventory tracking system for a small jewlery boutique that will allow me to track various types of jelwery, amount we have in stock and colors available. The goal for this is to be able to easily keep track of items being sold and see what's high in sales vs low.
